11. by one rule, these points are located 1.5 times the interquartile range away from a data set's first or third quartiles. the existence of these points can decrease the correlation coefficient and may cause inaccuracy in a data set's line of best fit. an example of one of these points is (*) 3000 in a data set whose median is 10. for 10 points, give this statistics term for data points that lie far away from other points.

12. an ensemble learning approach to finding these things relies on running the lof algorithm repeatedly and is a form of "feature bagging". the ransac method can be used in the presence of large numbers of these things. grubbs method for finding them relies on a test statistic consisting of the max residual over the standard deviation. winsorization is one method of dealing with these values, which are also the motivation behind the development of so-called (*) "robust" methods. the existence of a large number of these entities assuming a normal prior may indicate a high kurtosis in the underlying distribution. these things are generally plotted above or below the "whiskers" in a box-and-whisker plot and are usually one point five times the interquartile range beyond the upper or lower quartile. for 10 points, name these points in a data set which do not fit within the presumed distribution.

[10] considering the event "being an outlier" as a bernoulli outcome, then for a large number of datapoints and few expected outliers, their number follows this distribution. this distribution has mean equal to variance, and pdf proportional to lambda to the k over k-factorial.
[10] data points beyond the whiskers are frequently given this name, indicating that they are distant from the more "normal" values closer to the median of the data set.
[10] dixon's q test and grubb's test can be used to detect these, which are also the subject of peirce's and chauvenet's criterions. you probably should have trimmed them before making all the above computations. oops!
[10] for each set, you can easily compute this value by finding the mean, then computing the square of the difference between each value and the mean, then adding all those up. it is thus the square of the standard deviation.
[10] for heavy-tailed distributions this second central moment of a distribution function is typically, but not always, undefined. for a random variable x, this quantity is given by the expected value of the squared difference between x and the expected value of x.
[10] give this term for statistical data points that are very different from other observations. numerical ones bias the mean much more than the median.
[10] given your data and the variances you just computed, you can use this single-letter-named test developed by george snedecor to find out if the variances of the underlying populations are equal.
[10] in this paradox, a trend that arises in several different groups of data disappears when the data are combined. it may cause incorrect conclusions to be made about the causality between different variables.
[10] many statistical hypothesis tests will yield misleading results if the data are not independent; one example is this test devised by karl pearson, which uses a sum of squared errors to determine the relationship between categorical variables.
[10] name this measure that equals the square root of the average of the squares of the mean deviations.
[10] name this part of a distribution that is heavy in the pareto, weibull ("vey-bool"), and cauchy ("coh-shee") distributions. this part of a distribution is far away from the mean.
[10] one advantage of using the mode is robustness, or resilience to the effects of these data points that deviate far from the center. for normally distributed data, they lie further than three standard deviations from the mean.
[10] the commonly used tukey box-and-whisker plot deems outliers as values that are outside the interval whose respective endpoints are (read slowly) "quartile-one minus quantity this constant times the interquartile range close quantity" and "quartile-three plus quantity this constant times the interquartile range close quantity."
[10] the length of the "box" in a boxplot is given by this range between the data points in the twenty-fifth and seventy-fifth percentiles.
[10] the value of the distance between the ends of the box represents this measure of the "middle 50 percent" of a data set.
[10] these data points are depicted as circles or asterisks on a boxplot. they represent values that are unusually different from the rest of the data set and may indicate errors in their collection.
[10] these extreme values that are far away from the majority of points in a data set are more common in heavy-tailed distributions. these points are typically outside of the "whiskers" in a box plot.
[10] these observations, whose values differ greatly from the rest of a data set, may cause the means of small samples to be much higher than population means.
[10] this measure of central tendency is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency in a set of data.
[10] this statistician's namesake transform is used to stabilize the variance of poisson distributions. he constructed four very different sets of data with very similar statistical measures to emphasize the importance of graphing data.
[10] traditionally, outliers are data points greater than this many interquartile ranges beyond the upper or lower quartiles.
[10e] a line drawn inside the box of a boxplot represents this value. unlike the mean, this value is always exactly the midpoint of a dataset.
[10e] censoring data via winsorizing can reduce the influence of these observations in a sample. these observations, which are often influential points, are shown as points in a box plot because they feature extreme values.
[10e] name this technique used by dorothy hodgkin and barbara low to discover the structure of penicillin. in this technique, bragg's law is used to relate the angles and intensities of waves scattered from a lattice.
[10h] name this condition in which partial information about certain observations is missing from a sample. the "right" form of this condition is imposed upon data in which survival time is only known to exceed a certain value.
[10h] name this value, equal to the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles of a numerical dataset.
[10h] pdb structures are validated by molprobity, which measures r-free, a set of three outliers, and this value. this quantity counts the number of times per 1,000 atoms that van der waals radii overlap by 0.4 angstroms or more.
[10m] in one definition, these values in a dataset are either greater than or less than any value in the box by at least 1.5 times the iqr. these values differ significantly from the rest of the data.
[10m] winsorized estimators can be described by this general term because they are not greatly affected by outliers. this term describes parametric statistical methods that remain effective despite having their assumptions violated.
[10m] x-ray crystallography is the most common technique used to create atomic coordinate files for this structural database. users of this database download mmcif files to study structures in visualization systems such as pymol.
